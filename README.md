# ObservablesYMedidas

This library made in python contains the representation of complex numbers and the operations that can be performed between several complex numbers. There are also operations between complex number vectors and complex number matrices. It has a basic quantum theory implemented with functions that helps to understand the quantum mechanics. And test that are examples of observable and measuring exercises provided by the book of "Quantum Computing for computer scientist".
